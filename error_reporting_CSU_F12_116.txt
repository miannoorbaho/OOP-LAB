1)
	In constructor 'Data::Data()':
	
	My Idea:
	This single error lead to report 73 error in program. First I thought it would be issue with accessing constructor with colons as I was first time defining function out of the class.

	solution:
	String should be double quoted.

2)
	[Error] type 'std::string {aka class std::basic_string<char>}' argument given to 'delete', expected pointer

	My Idea:
	I think for destructor, it needs pointer of already created object to access exact memeory address of that object to perform deletion operation.

	Solution:
	Use pointer and through pointer process deletion then it will delete the exact memory location.

3)
	[Error] 'emp1' was not declared in this scope
	
	My Idea:
	As I altered code where objects were manually created, I used object array and initialized 5 objects at once. So automatically where emp1, emp2 and so on were used, they will be automatically undeclared objects.
	
	Solution:
	In general situation, declare the variable emp1 with its data type but in my situation I just put for loop variable in emp1[i] to make it executable.

4)
	[Error] invalid conversion from 'char' to 'char*' [-fpermissive]

	My Idea:
	I think it is due to I didn't passed pointer to the function instead I passed character type that is a mismatch.

	Solution:
